# Rainfall

This project serves as an introduction to exploiting ELF-like binaries through a series of progressively challenging levels. The **goal** of this project is to gain understanding of why small bad practices can lead to vulnerabilities in your code.

## How to run the project
You need to download the [rainfall .iso](https://cdn.intra.42.fr/isos/RainFall.iso) and then run it.  
In order to connect with `ssh` or copy file to your host machine with `scp`, you need to add a bridged network to the VM so that it can communicate with the host.

For VirtualBox :
1. Go to the VM Settings -> Network
2. Enable Network Adapter
3. Choose Bridged Adapter
